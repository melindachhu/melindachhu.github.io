        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Chemical Engineering Peer Advisors (ChEPA) serve as a resource for ChemE students who seek academic, professional, or involvement advice.
            We are a department-appointed organization here to serve you, the students. We provide academic advising sessions throughout the semester (attending one is required in order to remove the hold on ONE UF to register for classes), help with any questions you may have regarding chemical engineering and offer tours for prospective students. Under the supervision of Cynthia Sain, the Academic Coordinator, we aim to help students have a positive and successful learning experience here at the University of Florida.</p>
